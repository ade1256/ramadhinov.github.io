Happy to know about this world every I learn something new. I'm a human, so it really normal to forget something and anything, so I made this page to document every something _new_ for me.

I had to use [WordPress](http://wordpress.com) before with my [LinuxManNote](http://linuxmannote.wordpress.com) to share every thing I learn. I have so many help from community on [Telegram](http://telegram.org) such as [SinauDev](http://sinaudev.org), LibreOffice Indonesia, GNU/Linux Indonesia, PegeLinux Team, and many more. Learn from they who learn first and know first, because there is no late to find information.

This blog is my personal documentation, I write what I know with my point of view, I highly not recommend to use this site as reference fully. But if you read, then try, and get solution, I know god be with you. Share your story and make them know another view. If you found something wrong with my post, do not hesitate to contact me for better post and better documentation.

Last but not least, `Better an egg today than a cock tomorrow`.
